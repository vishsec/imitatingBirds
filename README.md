# imitatingBirds
# A java project based on imitating the movements of a flock of birds
# the birds are attached to vectors and their movements and positions are monitored by controlling the velocity of these boids
# the 3 basic principles on which this operates is * cohesion - the steer towards the centre of mass
#                                                  * alignment - the steer towards an averageheading of local flock
#                                                  * seperation - the steer to avoid collision with other boids in the flock
